- Youtube link (TBD)
- we want to plan ahead with the shared vision and improve scoping
- make teams of ~5 to work on given tasks or ideas
- we strive for ensuring openness and transparency and permisionless participation in
our organization
- our goal to make more accessible tools for the blockchain
- our KPIs - Monthly Active Contributors. Daily Transacions (when the app on
production), SNT value
- weak central leadership, owning the work on status
- core organelles of Status - avoid inward focus
- Idea proposals - the org change aimed to enable everyone to propose ideas
- Ideas can be process improvements. product features, research. etc
- test the merit of idea through discussions, prototyping an implementation
- ideas require contributors and a leader - make swarms that are committed to idea
- weâ€˜re thinking about 2 kind of commitments - full time 40hr/week, and half-time
20hrs/week
- how the requirements should be flashed out is still an open quesiton - important to
clarify the goal and what is required for the idea to be considered viable
- think about HVPs which we can iterate on
