### TL;DR; keep existing 4 tabs in the bottom and implement only new Wallet UI

Design call 9.08
- Main takeaway - keep existing 4 tabs in the bottom and implement only new Wallet UI
- Total UI change would be tough - we can start with the main wallet UI redesign only
- Change the main wallet screen to fit to the existing UI with the bottom tabs navigation 
- Android screens needs to be updated with the new wallet and the old tabs
- Q: Exchange btn in the main wallet screen - gray out or hide? - just gray out to promote it
- we don’t drop command line commands it’s still important differentiation
- the Chat tab needs revisiting (may be another title)
- keep the 4 tabs in the bottom until November 
- the Wallet needs to be done by Nov
- still question about the graphs for the wallets
- keep the commands
- branding? different colors for derived keys (not sure I got this)
- Contacts - keep in the bottom
- Transactions are now moved under the Wallet! (old dark screens -> new white ones)
- 3 words - implement during onboarding but we dont’ have the UI yet - Vic to create the Issue
- current wallet is not good in terms of Tx mgmt
- btm tabs - reorder - wallet - chat -discover - contacts
- future of status: no search for ethereum? how would we search (https://tribler.org/ContentSearch/), Jarrad to share the links/docs for consideration - create Search Issue (Vic)
- SIP start doing this (also contact sharing)
- on the process - mark up the screens that are approved, Zenhub plugin to show design approved per issues
- Zenhub should indicate issues that are done - use labels design-todo, design-in-progress, design-approved for the issues
