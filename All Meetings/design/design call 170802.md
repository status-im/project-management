# Design call notes 8/2/17

Attendance: Andrei, Anna, Jarrad, Vic

### TL;DR; Approved the Send Transaction screens with minor polishing required

- Can Status be listed in the Send to iOS apps @roman? @vic to create the issue https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/1578

- The chart should show total market value of the all assets (sourced from the 3rd party API)

- Assets filter screen would need revisiting (is toggles good?)

- Send transaction screen - remove `Save for later` functionality (no postponed transactions in Beta) - revisit in November

- But actually Send transaction screen cannot be approved - it is now blocked with the Done button functionality

- Transactions list - change `Pending` to `Unsigned`

*Approving screens:*
- Send transaction screen #1, #2 (explain the small screens case), polish the main screen
- Send transaction #3 - hide Advanced
- GNO screens can be approved: #1

All approved screens need polishing.

Approved screens must have Android asap.


*Not approved for now:*

- #4, #5 not approved (signing), but let's keep the `3 words` security option
- #4 - needs work - add tx summary
- the QR screens - need extra work from yesterday
- branch off the approved screens so the team can easily find them

*Important*

- Check the screens for the escape path
- any TOC and Privacy for Status?
