### TL;DR; Omnibar introduction

*Omnibar*
- remind that Status is Ethereum browser and we want to focus on this
- we now change the Chat vs Browser experience and call it `Omnibar`
- we’re talking about the browser first approach and how to align the user experience 
- make browser a single window for Chat, Dapp, and Web browsing
- the `Chat` tab becomes `Tabs` with the list of browsing/chat experiences 
- each browser window will be Browser with the Chat enabled as an option
- share the Omnibar idea with the team and follow up in the next design call for discussion
- create user stories and omnibar epic
- how to handle browsing history?

*Discover update*
- update on Discover was made - follow up with user stories
- as a user I want to be able to add custom Dapp 
- as a user I want to be able to personalize my feeds
- revisit the community driven content curation for Discover

*Profile update*
- make the side bar full screen
- add the `show public key QR`
- how/why show the phone number? how do we use the phone # for connecting with contacts?
- do not show phone # of others in user’s profiles
- Fireside chat question - how often you need the public key QR?
- profile update - 2 phases - current improvement, later redesign
- profile update - revisit the `what we want to change` within the total profile redesign?
